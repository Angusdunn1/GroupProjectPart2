# FFT-Based Diffusion Simulation

This project solves the 1D diffusion equation using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and simulates the spread of an infection in a population using a spectral method. The model includes temporary immunity, vaccination zones, and random agent movement.

## 🔬 Key Features

- Uses spectral methods to solve diffusion efficiently
- Simulates infection, recovery, and temporary immunity
- Includes a vaccination station with probabilistic vaccination
- Animated visualization of agent states over time

## 🎥 Simulation Animation

Below is a demo of the simulation showing the spread of infection, recovery, immunity, and vaccination.
